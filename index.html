    <h1>Welcome to My Static Website</h1>

    <p>
        This is the first paragraph of my website. It explains the main topic I chose
        and gives the user a little background about it. The sentences should be long enough
        to meet the assignment requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the second paragraph. You can talk about anything—your hobbies, a project,
        something interesting you learned, or even describe how AWS hosting works.
        Just make sure it's at least 3 sentences long.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the third paragraph that finishes the section. The point is to show
        that you can structure a simple HTML document with valid paragraphs
        and styling. You can edit this text however you want.
